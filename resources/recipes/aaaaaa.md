# Preparation

## Step 1
1. Place a rack in the middle of the oven; preheat to 325°.
2. Line an 8x8" baking pan with parchment paper, leaving overhang on all sides.
3. Pulse 1¼ cups (156 g) all-purpose flour, ¼ cup (28 g) powdered sugar, and ¾ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a food processor to combine.
4. Add 7 Tbsp. chilled unsalted butter, cut into pieces, and pulse until the mixture is sandy with very small butter pieces.
5. Add 1 large egg yolk and pulse until combined; the mixture will be very dry looking and powdery but should hold together when squeezed in your hand.

## Step 2
1. Transfer the mixture to the prepared pan and spread it into an even layer to fill the pan.
2. Using a flat-bottomed measuring cup or glass, pack into a compressed layer (use your fingers to get into the corners).
3. Bake the crust until golden, 27–29 minutes.
4. Let it cool for 5 minutes (don’t go longer; it needs to be warm when you add the lemon mixture).

## Step 3
1. While the crust is baking, place 1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar and 2 tsp. finely grated lemon zest in a medium bowl.
2. Using your fingers, massage the zest into sugar until fragrant and lightly tinted yellow, about 1 minute.
3. Add 3 large eggs, remaining 1 large egg yolk, and remaining 3 Tbsp. (23 g) all-purpose flour and gently whisk just until combined.
4. Add ⅔ cup fresh lemon juice, ¼ cup whole milk, and remaining ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt; stir to combine.

## Step 4
1. Pour the filling over the slightly cooled crust and gently tap the pan on the counter to pop any air bubbles on the surface.
2. Bake until the lemon mixture is set but still jiggles slightly when gently shaken, 20–25 minutes.
3. Let the lemon bar cool, then chill until cold, at least 4 hours.

## Step 5
1. Using parchment paper overhang, lift the lemon bar from the pan and place it on a cutting board.
2. Cut into 16 squares.

## Step 6
1. Dust lemon bars with powdered sugar just before serving.

## Do Ahead:
- Lemon bars (without powdered sugar topping) can be baked 2 days ahead. Cover and keep chilled.
