## Soup Base:

- 2 parts brand dark mushroom soy sauce (most important part).
- 1 part brand light soy sauce.
- 2 parts white pepper, 4 parts if not freshly ground.
- 1/2 part salt.
- 1 part sugar.
- 1/2 part chili oil.
- 1 part sesame oil.
- 1/2 part garlic powder.
  
*Note: 1 part is equivalent to 1 tablespoon. Make a larger quantity for multiple batches.*

## Prep:

1. Start by freezing the pork for half an hour so it’s easy to cut. Slice into tiny strips and toss in a bit of cornstarch slurry.
2. Cut all the veggies into tiny slices. Matchsticks for the bamboo and tiny slices for the mushrooms. Tofu into quarter-inch by one-inch chunks, and dice the chilis. Keep the seeds from one pepper.
3. Beat the egg with a splash of sake or vinegar.

## Cook:

1. Bring the chicken and beef stock to a boil, then toss in the pork strips.
2. Once it gets back to a boil, put in the soup base. Add the mushrooms and bamboo, let it get back to a boil.
3. Add the tofu and let it cook for a minute. Then add vinegar.
4. Let it all get back to a boil, then slowly stir in the cornstarch until it just starts to firm up. You won’t need to use all of it. It should be sticky to the back of the spoon if you did it right.
5. Taste it now. More hot? More white pepper and chili oil. More sour? More vinegar.
6. Let it get to a good boil, like seriously bubbling before you make the soup into a whirlpool. Spin it around with the ladle in your left hand while you slowly stir in the eggs you beat with the little wine. They’re gonna make beautiful little ribbons.
7. Toss in scallions at the end with a little fried garlic.
