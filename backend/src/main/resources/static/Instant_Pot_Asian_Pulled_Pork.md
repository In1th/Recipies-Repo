# Instant Pot Asian Pulled Pork (Tacos and Rice Bowls)

Prep Time: 15 minutes  
Cook Time: 1 hour 15 minutes  
Total Time: 1 hour 30 minutes  
Servings: 6  

*Gather all the ingredients.*

1. Cut 1 onion into big chunks.
2. Cut the ginger knob into 5–6 slices ginger. Peel and smash 6 cloves of garlic.
3. Cut off and discard the butcher’s twine from your 1.25 kg pork shoulder (pork butt). Season all sides of the roast with 2 tsp Diamond Crystal kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.

## To Sauté the Ingredients:

1. Press the Sauté button on your electric pressure cooker (I use a 6 QT Instant Pot).
2. When the inner pot is hot, add 1 Tbsp neutral oil. Select the High setting on Sauté mode, if your cooker has the option.
3. Sear all sides of the pork shoulder, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer the pork to a clean plate and set aside.
4. Add the ginger slices and smashed garlic cloves to the pot and sauté for 2–3 minutes. Once fragrant, add the chopped onion and toss to coat with the oil.
5. Next, add chicken stock/broth, soy sauce, and sake. Stir to combine.
6. Add brown sugar and mix well, scraping the juicy brown bits stuck to the bottom of the pot. Finally, add the pork shoulder back into the pot.

## To Cook under Pressure:

1. Cover and lock the lid. Make sure the steam release handle points at Sealing.
2. Press the Keep Warm/Cancel button to stop the Sauté function. Then, select the Pressure Cooking mode.
3. Set the cooking time to 60 minutes and select High pressure. Press Start. It'll take about 15 minutes to reach full pressure.
4. In a Stovetop Pressure Cooker: If using a stovetop pressure cooker, close and lock the lid and set over medium-high heat until the cooker reaches high pressure. Reduce the heat to low to maintain high pressure for about 60 minutes.
5. In a Slow Cooker: In your slow cooker or crockpot, cook on High for 5–6 hours or Low for 8–10 hours.
6. In a Pot on the Stove: Cook, covered, in a heavy-bottomed pot on a low simmer for 2–3 hours on the stove.
7. When finished cooking, the Instant Pot will switch automatically to the Keep Warm mode. Slide the steam release handle to the Venting position to quick release the pressure until the float valve drops down. Alternatively, let the pressure release naturally for about 15 minutes.
8. Unlock and remove the lid, then transfer the roast to a rimmed baking sheet pan.

## To Prepare the Pulled Pork:

1. Shred the pork with two forks.
2. While optional, remove excess oil and fat from the cooking liquid in the pot. Gently submerge a ladle into the liquid to skim off only the oil and fat at the surface, leaving the flavorful liquid behind. Discard excess oil.
3. Put the pulled pork back into the pot, and toss everything so that the pork soaks up the flavors of the sauce.
4. Press the Sauté button again to reheat the pork. Serve immediately or transfer to an oven-safe skillet if you want to give the pulled pork a nice char (optional).
5. Put the skillet in the oven and broil on High for 3–5 minutes until the shredded pork on the surface crisps and browns.

## To Serve:
