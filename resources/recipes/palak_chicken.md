## Instructions

### Preparation

#### How to Make Palak Chicken
1. Add chicken to a large mixing bowl. Sprinkle ¼ teaspoon salt, black pepper, red chilli powder, and lemon juice. Mix and set aside until needed.

2. Pour 1 teaspoon oil into a hot pan and add cashews and green chilies. Stir fry until the chilies blister. Add spinach (cleaned, rinsed, and drained) and stir fry on medium heat until wilted and fully cooked, for 6 mins. Turn off the heat & cool this.

3. Pour ½ cup cold water into a blender and transfer the spinach, chilies, and cashews. You may set aside some of the green chilies which you can adjust later.

4. Make a smooth puree and taste test. If you want more heat, add back the green chilis that were set aside and blend.

### How to Make Palak Chicken (continued)

1. Add the rest of the oil (along with ghee if using) to a hot pan. Add all the whole spices and let them sizzle. Stir in the chopped onions and saute until light brown & really soft.

2. Stir in the ginger garlic and saute for a minute, until aromatic.

3. Add tomatoes and salt. Stir well and cook until the tomatoes lose their raw flavor. If you want, you may cook covered at this stage.

4. Add the marinated chicken and stir fry on medium-high heat until pale. Stir in the garam masala.

5. Pour ½ to ¾ cup hot water and mix well. Cook covered on medium heat until the chicken is fully cooked through.

6. Stir in the Spinach puree. If the palak chicken gravy is too thick, you may pour a little hot water.

7. Simmer until bubbling hot and cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Taste test and adjust salt. Take kasuri methi in your palms and crush it well. Sprinkle all over. Turn off the heat. Keep the gravy slightly runny if you want to serve it with rice. It thickens slightly upon cooling.
